# jot

**Brutally simple command line app for jotting things down.**

---

## Getting started
- Build the source code;
- Add the binary file path to PATH;
- Open Terminal and begin your note with the `jot` command;
- The first time the `jot` command is executed 
a file 'jot.txt' is created in the home directory, 
where the data will be written.

## Examples
`jot Hello World` writes 'Hello World'

Special characters should be put in quotes or escaped. 
There are several ways to type 'Hello World :)':

`jot "Hello World :)"`

`jot Hello World ":)"`

`jot Hello World :\)`
